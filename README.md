# Building Secure AI Agents: Defense-First Development

## Half-day workshop (3 hours) &mdash; Revision 1.0

These instructions will guide you through configuring a GitHub Codespaces
environment that you can use to run the workshop labs.

This workshop is for **agent builders**. Across five labs you take one
deliberately vulnerable AI support agent and harden it, layer by layer:
guardrails and canary tokens, least-privilege tool controls, a scoped MCP
server, RAG poisoning defenses, and observability. The final lab
(observability) is designed to also work as post-class homework if time runs
short.

### Prerequisites

Experience building AI agents (via the AI Accelerator, an agents workshop, or
equivalent), comfort with Python, and a basic understanding of agent
architectures (ReAct, tool calling, MCP). No prior security background is
assumed &mdash; every term is defined as it comes up.

<br><br>

**1. Change your codespace's default timeout from 30 minutes to longer.**
When logged in to GitHub, go to https://github.com/settings/codespaces and
scroll down to the *Default idle timeout* section. Adjust the value as desired.

<br><br>

**2. Click on the button below to start a new codespace from this repository.**

Click here ➡️  [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/skillrepos/secure-agents?quickstart=1)

<br><br>

**3. Then click on the option to create a new codespace.**

This will run for a long time while it gets everything ready.

After the initial startup, it will run a script to setup the python environment and install needed python pieces. This will take several more minutes to run. It will look like this while this is running.

The codespace is ready to use when you see a prompt like the one shown below in its terminal.

**4. Set up your Groq API key (for the cloud LLM).**
 
This enables the more powerful models and the real Llama Guard 4 safety classifier used in Lab 1.  Create your free Groq key now (while your codespace finishes building) and set it. Follow the directions below.
 
A. Go to [https://console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) and sign up or log in. No credit card is required for the free tier.

![groq console](./images/v3appb33.png?raw=true "groq console")
 
<br><br>

B. Navigate to [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys) and click *Create API Key*.

<br><br>

C. Give it a name, create it, and copy the key value. Save it somewhere — you won't be able to view it again.

The labs can still run without a key &mdash; they fall back to the local Ollama model
&mdash; but a Groq key makes them faster and unlocks Llama Guard.

<br><br>

**4. Ensure the codespace is done setting up.** 
After the initial startup, it will run a script to setup the python environment and install needed python pieces. This will take several more minutes to run. It will look like this while this is running.

![Final prep](./images/31ai2.png?raw=true "Final prep")

The codespace is ready to use when you see a prompt like the one shown below in its terminal.

<br><br>

**5. Set your Groq key in the codespace.**
In the codespace **TERMINAL**, run the command below, paste your key when
prompted, and hit *Enter*:

```
source scripts/setup-key.sh
```

You should see that `AGENT_PROVIDER` and `GROQ_API_KEY` are set.

<br><br>

**6. Run the warm-up script for faster first responses.**

```
python scripts/warmup_ollama.py
```

<br><br>

**7. Open `labs.md`** and follow along. You can open it in the codespace
(right-click > *Open Preview*) or in a separate browser tab.

**Now you are ready for the labs!**

<br><br>

### The five labs

| Lab | Focus | Directory |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Prompt-injection defense: guardrails, PII redaction, canary tokens | `guardrails/` |
| 2 | Securing agent tool calls: least privilege, approval gates, budgets | `agents/` |
| 3 | Hardening MCP servers: JWT auth + per-tool scopes | `mcp/` |
| 4 | RAG pipeline hardening: source allowlists, injection detection, output scanning | `rag/` |
| 5 | Auditing & observability: OpenTelemetry spans + anomaly detection *(homework-capable)* | `observability/` |

<br><br>

### Reopening a timed-out codespace

1. Go to https://github.com/codespaces
2. Find the codespace, right-click, and select *Open in browser*
3. Repeat steps 5 & 6 above to set the Groq key and re-run the warm-up.

<br><br>

## Troubleshooting

- **A lab reports it cannot reach Ollama** &mdash; the server isn't running. Run `bash scripts/startup_ollama.sh --skip-pull` from the repo root, then retry. Check `/tmp/ollama.log` if it persists.
- **The first model call is slow (~30-60s)** &mdash; run `python scripts/warmup_ollama.py` once, then retry. Later calls in the same session are fast.
- **Groq returns 429 (rate limit)** &mdash; you've exceeded the free tier. Wait a few seconds and retry, or `export LLM_BACKEND=ollama` to switch to the local model. Each person should use their own key.
- **Groq returns 401 / invalid key** &mdash; `GROQ_API_KEY` is missing or wrong. Re-copy it from console.groq.com, or unset it to fall back to Ollama.
- **A `python` command "hangs"** &mdash; the RAG and MCP labs use interactive prompts or run servers. Follow the lab's stop instruction (`quit` or `Ctrl+C`).
- **`Address already in use` in Lab 3** &mdash; a previous server is still running. Stop it with `Ctrl+C`, or `kill $(lsof -t -i:8000)`.
- **`ModuleNotFoundError`** &mdash; run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the repo root (inside the `py_env` virtualenv).
- **Skeleton file errors before merging** &mdash; skeletons are completed via the `code -d` diff-merge step first. Each lab tells you when to merge.
