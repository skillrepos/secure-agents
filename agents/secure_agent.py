Lab 4 - Securing Agents (SKELETON)

A REAL model drives an HR assistant agent that works a support ticket. The
ticket is a POISONED document: alongside a normal "summarize the benefits
update" request, it hides instructions telling the agent to export employee
data, email it outside the company, and delete the audit log. This is indirect
prompt injection -- the payload rides in data the model reads, not in anything
the user typed.

NOTE: incomplete. As shipped, the three control functions below are no-ops --
allowed_tools() offers every tool, approve() approves everything, and
within_budget() never stops the agent. So the "secured" run behaves exactly
like the undefended one: the hijack fires in BOTH. Run it once to see that,
then merge the real controls from extra/secure_agent_complete.txt and re-run to
watch the same poisoned ticket get contained.

You will implement three functions:
  1. allowed_tools()  - least privilege: expose ONLY the tools the task needs.
  2. approve()        - human approval gate for high-risk tools.
  3. within_budget()  - hard caps so a hijacked agent can't loop or escalate.
