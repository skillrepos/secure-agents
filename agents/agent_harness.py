Lab 2 - the agent HARNESS (provided complete - nothing to change here).

This file runs the agent: it asks the real model for a plan, executes the
plan once undefended and once with your three controls switched on, and
prints what happened. Your controls live in secure_agent.py; this file just
calls them. You don't need to read it to do the lab.
